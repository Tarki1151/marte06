/**
 * GymEntra: promotes the first person on a class waitlist when a spot frees up.
 *
 * Security rules deliberately cannot do this. Booking is modelled as a
 * single-uid self-toggle — a member may only add or remove their OWN uid, in
 * exactly one array, per write. Promotion moves a *different* user's uid
 * between two arrays in one write, which that model cannot express safely, so
 * until now an admin had to notice a cancellation and promote by hand.
 *
 * Runs with the Admin SDK, so it is the one place that write is safe.
